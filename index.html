            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <p>I'm currrently studying computer programming and spending most of my time learning by building random projects. I care more about progress than perfection, and I enjoy the process of figuring things out on my own. <br>Outside of coding, I'm into creative work like <span style="color: rgb(190, 255, 217);">Photography</span> and arts. I love capturing things I see from my point of view and presenting them to the rest of the world.
